How to Use Floating Note

Basic Usage
Type and edit your notes in the main window. Your note is automatically saved as a new file (with the current date and time) every time you close the app.

Notes Manager
Click the Notes button at the bottom to open the Notes Manager.
Save Current Note As...: Enter a name and save the current note with a timestamp.
New Blank Note Page: Clears the main note area for a fresh note.
Load Selected Note: Select a note and load it into the main window.
Delete Selected Note: Select a note and delete it (with confirmation).
Double-click a note in the list to load it.

Quick Command: Open a Note
In the main note area, type:
open(note-name)
and press Enter.
This will open the note file with the given name (ignoring the date/time).
If multiple files match, you’ll get an error listing them.
If no file matches, you’ll get a “File Not Found” error.

Shortcuts
Ctrl+X: Show/hide the Floating Note window.
Ctrl+Shift+Q: Quit the app.

Resizing & Moving
Drag the window border to resize.
Hold Ctrl and drag anywhere in the window to move it.


Antivirus Warning
This app is NOT a virus or malware.
Because this program is a custom-made Windows executable (created with Python and PyInstaller), some antivirus programs or Windows Defender may block or warn about it when you try to download or run it. This is a common “false positive” for new or rarely-seen apps.
What to Do If You Get a Warning
You may need to whitelist the app in your antivirus or Windows Defender settings.
You may need to temporarily disable your antivirus to run the app for the first time.
If you trust the source (this GitHub page), it is safe to run.
Why Does This Happen?
The app is not code-signed and is new, so antivirus software does not recognize it.
Many antivirus programs are extra cautious with new or custom-made software.
What’s Inside?
100% open source Python code (see bobble.py).
No malicious code, no data collection, no ads.
If you have any concerns, you can review the source code yourself or run the app in a virtual machine. If you have questions, feel free to open an issue
